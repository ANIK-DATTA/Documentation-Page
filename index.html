				Git is an open-source distributed version control system. It is designed to handle minor to major projects with high speed and efficiency. It is developed to co-ordinate the work among the developers. The version control allows us to track and work together with our team members at the same workspace.

				Git is foundation of many services like GitHub and GitLab, but we can use Git without using any other Git services. Git can be used privately and publicly.

				Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to develop Linux Kernel. It is also used as an important distributed version-control tool for the DevOps.

			<header><h2>Basic Terminology</h2></header>
			<main>
				<h3>Repository:</h3>
				<p>A repository a.k.a. repo is nothing but a collection of source code.</p>
				<h3>Control System:</h3>
				<p>This basically means that Git is a content tracker. So Git can be used to store content — it is mostly used to store code due to the other features it provides.</p>
				<h3>Version Control System:</h3>
				<p>Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. So ideally, we can place any file in the computer on version control.</p>
				<h3>Distributed Version Control System: </h3>
				<p> Git has a remote repository which is stored in a server and a local repository which is stored in the computer of each developer. This means that the code is not just stored in a central server, but the full copy of the code is present in all the developers’ computers. Git is a Distributed Version Control System since the code is present in every developer’s computer.</p>
				<h3>Branch:</h3>
				<p>A branch is a version of the repository that diverges from the main working project. It is an essential feature available in most modern version control systems. A Git project can have more than one branch. We can perform many operations on Git branch-like rename, list, delete, etc.</p>
				<h3>Checkout</h3>
				<p>In Git, the term checkout is used for the act of switching between different versions of a target entity. The git checkout command is used to switch between branches in a repository.</p>
				<h3>Clone</h3>
				<p>The git clone is a Git command-line utility. It is used to make a copy of the target repository or clone it. If I want a local copy of my repository from GitHub, this tool allows creating a local copy of that repository on your local directory from the repository URL.</p>
				<h3>Fetch</h3>
				<p>It is used to fetch branches and tags from one or more other repositories, along with the objects necessary to complete their histories. It updates the remote-tracking branches.</p>
				<h3>Master</h3>
				<p>Master is a naming convention for Git branch. It's a default branch of Git. After cloning a project from a remote server, the resulting local repository contains only a single local branch. This branch is called a "master" branch. It means that "master" is a repository's "default" branch.</p>
				<h3>Merge</h3>
				<p>Merging is a process to put a forked history back together. The git merge command facilitates you to take the data created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.</p>
				<h3>Origin</h3>
				<p>In Git, "origin" is a reference to the remote repository from a project was initially cloned. More precisely, it is used instead of that original repository URL to make referencing much easier.</p>
				<h3>Pull/ Pull Request:</h3>
				<p>The term Pull is used to receive data from GitHub. It fetches and merges changes on the remote server to your working directory. The git pull command is used to make a Git pull.

				Pull requests are a process for a developer to notify team members that they have completed a feature. Once their feature branch is ready, the developer files a pull request via their remote server account. Pull request announces all the team members that they need to review the code and merge it into the master branch.</p>
				<h3>Push:</h3>
				<p>The push term refers to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is an act of transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repository. Pushing is capable of overwriting changes; caution should be taken when pushing.</p>
				<h3>Remote:</h3>
				<p>In Git, the term remote is concerned with the remote repository. It is a shared repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. A remote repository is stored on a code hosting service like an internal server, GitHub, Subversion and more.</p>
				<h3>Upstream and Downstream</h3>
				<p>The term upstream and downstream is a reference of the repository. Generally, upstream is where you cloned the repository from (the origin) and downstream is any project that integrates your work with other works. However, these terms are not restricted to Git repositories.</p>
				<h3>Fork</h3>
				<p>A fork is a rough copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely test and debug with changes without affecting the original project.
				Great use of using forks to propose changes for bug fixes.</p>

			<header><h2>Basic Commands</h2></header>
			<main>
				<h3>1. git init</h3>
				<p>he very first thing you need to do is to initialize your project folder to use git.
 					We do this by using the git init command.</p>
				<code id="code">$ git init</code>
				<h3>2. git clone</h3>
				<p>git clone helps you to clone a repository from a remote location like Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc.</p>
				<code id="code">$ git clone <:remote-url:></code>
				<h3>3. git add</h3>
				<p>to add the changes you have made to the git system</p>
				<code>$ git add <:file name:></code>
				<h3>4. git commit</h3>
				<p>Git commit is like setting a checkpoint in the development process which you can go back to later if needed.</p>
				<code>$ git commit -m "commit message"</code>
				<h3>5. git push</h3>
				<p>git push updates the remote repository with any commits made locally to a branch</p>
				<code>$ git push origin <: branch-name-you-have made commits on:></code>
				<h3>6. git pull</h3>
				<p>git pull update the local repository with updates from its remote counterpart, i.e. remote repository.</p>	
				<code>$ git pull <:remote></code>
